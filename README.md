# Data Center Cooling Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing energy efficiency in data center cooling systems
by modeling the trade-off between energy consumption and hardware risk.

## Problem Description
Low fan speed increases hardware failure risk, while high fan speed significantly
increases energy consumption. The goal is to find the optimal fan speed that minimizes
total cost.

## Method
- Mathematical modeling of total cost
- Optimization using Newton–Raphson method
- Numerical solution and convergence analysis

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Numerical Analysis
- Optimization Methods

## Results
The optimal fan speed was found to be approximately **v ≈ 24**, which minimizes
the total cost function.
